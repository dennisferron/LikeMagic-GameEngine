Do not try to use template <typename F, F f> to hard-code function pointer addresses.
Although this does work (it is how the original design worked), there is no way to
simultaneously make a template function deduce both F and f, unfortunately.

Do not try to refactor out SFMO::Proxy classes to unify them with Expressions.
It creates circular dependencies among AbstractExpression, Expression, and Term.
Wasted 1 day on this.

Do not try to support default function arguments by arbitrarily limiting the
number of type arguments at MakeCall.  By the time MakeCall receives the function
pointer f, it knows it only by its signature and has no way of knowing that the
original function that provided the address had default arguments or what the defaults are.
This could be supported if we went back to a hard-coded template <typename F, F f> design,
but a far better alternative is to wait for GCC 4.5 to come out, and use lambda
functions as wrappers for functions that use default args.

Before adding new features to LikeMagic using C++, consider whether the same feature could
be implemented in script instead.  This might involve giving script more access
to LikeMagic metadata, which is a Good Thing because it not only enables the current
feature, but provides building blocks that could be used to implement future features
entirely in script too.
(Wasted 0.5 days writing preliminary C++ code for serialization only to realize
it could be an Io script if the right metadata and API functions are exposed.)
